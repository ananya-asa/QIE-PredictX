# 🟩 PREDICTX — AI-POWERED DECENTRALIZED PREDICTION PROTOCOL  
### (QIE Testnet Deployment • Mainnet-Ready Architecture)

PredictX is a fully on-chain prediction protocol where users stake PMT tokens, 
submit AI-generated valuations, and earn blockchain-verified rewards based on accuracy.

This system combines:

✔ Real-time AI valuation  
✔ Real on-chain oracle values  
✔ Smart-contract staking & settlement  
✔ Automated accuracy-based rewards  
✔ Persistent on-chain user stats & history  

All components are deployed live on the **QIE Testnet** and designed to migrate seamlessly to **QIE Mainnet**.

# ⚙ SYSTEM FEATURES

## 1️⃣ AI VALUATION ENGINE (HUGGINGFACE)
PredictX integrates a real HuggingFace model to generate:

- Estimated USD value  
- Confidence percentage  

These predictions are used for staking + settlement.

---

## 2️⃣ ON-CHAIN ORACLE VALUE SYSTEM
An Oracle Admin updates the **true market value** for each asset.

Oracle values are used for:

- Calculating prediction error  
- Determining accuracy  
- Computing user rewards  
- Updating market benchmarks  

This is entirely on-chain and stored immutably.

---

## 3️⃣ STAKING & PREDICTION SUBMISSION
Users deposit PMT tokens and submit:

- Asset ID  
- AI-generated predicted value  
- Confidence  
- Stake amount  

The prediction is permanently stored on-chain through smart contracts.

---

## 4️⃣ AUTOMATED SETTLEMENT CONTRACT
The settlement engine:

- Calculates absolute error  
- Computes accuracy factor  
- Allocates PMT rewards  
- Updates user accuracy score  
- Marks prediction as settled  

### Reward Formula:
```
reward = (stake * confidence% * accuracyFactor)
```

Everything is computed and distributed automatically.

---

## 5️⃣ CLAIMABLE USER REWARDS
Users can:

- View total earnings  
- Claim PMT rewards  
- Check prediction statistics  
- Monitor accuracy progress  

Smart contract instantly transfers tokens.

---

## 6️⃣ PREDICTION HISTORY + PERFORMANCE STATS
Users see:

- Predicted value  
- Confidence  
- Stake amount  
- Reward earned  
- Error  
- Accuracy %  
- Timestamp  

A complete historical record stored on-chain.
